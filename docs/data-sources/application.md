Use this data source to access information about an existing Application within Azure Active Directory.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "azuread_application" "example" {
  display_name = "My First AzureAD Application"
}

output "azure_ad_object_id" {
  value = data.azuread_application.example.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `application_id` - (Optional) Specifies the Application ID (also called Client ID).
* `display_name` - (Optional) Specifies the display name of the application.
* `object_id` - (Optional) Specifies the Object ID of the application.

~> **NOTE:** One of `object_id`, `application_id` or `display_name` must be specified.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `api` - An `api` block as documented below.

`api` block exports the following:

* `accept_mapped_claims` - Allows an application to use claims mapping without specifying a custom signing key.

* `oauth2_permission_scope` - One or more `oauth2_permission_scope` blocks as documented below, to describe delegated permissions exposed by the web API represented by this application.
* `requested_access_token_version` - The access token version expected by this resource. Possible values are `1` or `2`.

---

`oauth2_permission_scope` block exports the following:

* `admin_consent_description` - Delegated permission description that appears in all tenant-wide admin consent experiences, intended to be read by an administrator granting the permission on behalf of all users.

* `enabled` - Determines if the permission scope is enabled.
* `id` - The unique identifier of the delegated permission. Must be a valid UUID.
